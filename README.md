API interface to backend database

Note that these files are pulled from the direcetory hierarchy to demonstrate the REST API interface to the database backend, but are outside of the normal tree context (cannot comile directly).

API.d.ts provides the function definitions for the API interface
app.js implements those API functions and translates to the backend database
